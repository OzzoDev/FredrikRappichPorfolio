# Resume & Company Website - Rappich Consulting AB

## Overview

Welcome to my personal **Resume** and **Company** website! My name is **Fredrik Rappich**, and I’m a former HR professional who is currently transitioning into the **IT field**. I’m mainly focused on **C/C++** development, but I’m creating this website as part of my journey to learn how to build and deploy websites. 

This site serves as both a personal resume and a showcase for **Rappich Consulting AB**, the company I run part time while learning system development, offering **HR** and **IT development** consulting services. Through this project, I aim to develop my skills in **front-end web development**, **design**, and **deployment**, while also creating a professional presence online.

The website includes sections such as:
- **About Me**
- **Skills**
- **Projects**
- **Experience**
- **Education**
- **Contact**

Additionally, I’ve incorporated a company page showcasing **Rappich Consulting AB**, with details about our consulting services in **HR** and **IT development**.
