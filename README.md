# Rappich Consulting AB - Website (Learning Journey)

## Introduction
This repository is part of my ongoing journey in learning web development. I'm currently building a website for my company, **Rappich Consulting AB**, while learning key programming languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, C++, and more. The website is meant to be the frontpage of my consulting business, which focuses on both HR services and IT development, specifically digital transformation and web development.

### **Why This Project?**
As part of my transition into the IT field, I am learning how to develop websites and web applications. The website will serve as both a learning platform and a professional portfolio that I can showcase to potential clients or employers.

### **What I'm Learning**
- **HTML/CSS**: How to structure and style a website.
- **JavaScript**: Making the website interactive and responsive.
- **Git/GitHub**: Learning version control and hosting a live site on GitHub Pages.
- **C++**: Integrating backend technologies and learning systems programming.

### **Tech Stack**
This is the tech stack I plan to use and learn during the process:
- **Frontend**:
  - HTML5: For website structure and content.
  - CSS3: For styling and design.
  - JavaScript: For interactivity and dynamic behavior.
- **Version Control**:
  - Git: To manage versions and track changes.
  - GitHub: To host the repository and deploy the website using GitHub Pages.
- **Backend** (future development):
  - C++: Learning backend programming and how to work with databases.
  - Node.js (Optional): For backend web development with JavaScript.
  - SQL/NoSQL (Optional): To manage and store data.
- **Hosting**:
  - GitHub Pages: For free static website hosting.

### **Current Goal**
The current goal is to build a simple, static website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that showcases the services and vision of Rappich Consulting AB. Later on, I will integrate more advanced technologies such as backend programming and databases.

### **Project Structure**
1. **index.html**: Homepage structure and layout.
2. **styles.css**: Styling for the website.
3. **scripts.js**: Interactive features and form validation.

### **How to Contribute (Learning and Sharing)**
As I continue to learn, I encourage feedback and contributions to this repository. If you have suggestions for improvements, feel free to submit a pull request. This project is a personal learning experience, and I'd love to improve my skills with feedback from others!

### **Future Updates**
Once the website is deployed and fully developed, this README will be updated to reflect the final product, including the live link and detailed descriptions of the features.
